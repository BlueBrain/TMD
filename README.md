# TMD

A python package for the topological analysis of neurons.

The TMD performs the topological analysis of neuronal morphologies and extracts the persistence
barcodes of trees.

This Python module includes:

* Basic loading of neuronal morphologies in swc and h5 file format.
* Extraction of the topological descriptors of tree morphologies.
* Visualization of neuronal trees and neurons.
* Plotting persistence diagrams, barcodes and images.


## Installation

This package should be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install TMD
```

For installation of optional viewers:

```bash
pip install TMD[viewer]
```


## Usage

```python
# Import the TMD toolkit in IPython
import tmd

# Load a neuron
neuron = tmd.io.load_neuron('input_path_to_file/input_file.swc')

# Extract the tmd of a neurite, i.e., neuronal tree
pd = tmd.methods.get_persistence_diagram(neuron.neurites[0])
```
